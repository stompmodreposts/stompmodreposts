    <h3>This might be a noobish site,<br>
       but mod reposts is a BIG problem. <br>

     And we need to STOP IT ALREADY!!</h3>
     <h1>What are "mod reposts?"</h1>
     <h2>Long story short, it is a BADBADBADBAD thing.</h2>

     <p><b>First, An example:</b><br>
     Lets say... lets say you... you coded some premium<br>
     software and listed the software for $29.99.<br>
     Then as you were browsing the internet, <br>
     you found your premium software behind an AdFly <br>
     link listed for free. Not only is someone else <br>
     making money off YOUR software (because of the AdFly link)<br>
     they are also<br>
      1. taking credit,<br>
       2. stealing YOUR money, and<br>
       3. putting YOU at a HIGHER RISK of becoming <br>
       broke and becoming a school janitor instead of <br>
       you following YOUR dreams! :( :( &#9785   </p>
