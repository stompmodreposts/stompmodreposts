     <div id="example">
     <p><b>First, An example:</b><br>
     Lets say... lets say you... you coded some premium<br>
     software and listed the software for $29.99.<br>
     Then as you were browsing the internet, <br>
     you found your premium software behind an AdFly <br>
     link listed for free. Not only is someone else <br>
     making money off YOUR software (because of the AdFly link)<br>
     they are also<br>

        1. taking credit,<br>
          2. stealing YOUR money, and<br>
         3. putting YOU at a HIGHER RISK of becoming <br>
        broke and becoming a school janitor instead of <br>
        you following YOUR dreams! :( :( &#9785;    

     Again, That is  <br>
      1. taking credit,<br>
       2. stealing YOUR money, and<br>
       3. putting YOU at a HIGHER RISK of becoming <br>
       broke and becoming a school janitor instead of <br>
       you following YOUR dreams! :( :( &#9785;  </p></div>

         <h4>Hopefully you get the idea through that example. <br>
         for The explanation from <a href='https://www.stopmodreposts.org'>stopmodreposts</a> click that link.</h4>
         <h5>also the.. the name "mod reposts"is self-explanitory. <br>
         on stopmodreposts there is an extention to block repost <br>
       sites, and i have another tip : Download the <a href='https://app.twitch.tv'>Twitch Launcher</a> or the <a href='#mas-info'>TechnicPack Launcher</a><br>
       and only download mods/modpacks/maps/resource packs from there. (if the maker of stopmodreposts reads this, <br>
       Please dont get discouraged from these words. your extention is a great idea if people do not like twitch or technicpack.)</h5>
