# stompmodreposts
i have *NO* idea how to make a readme md and if u want info use the index html file.    
nevermind what i just said.  all that is 4 da lols  
stomp mod reposts is a port of stopmodreposts, i should not say port because i wrote it from scratch.    

althouh stopmodreposts is focoused on mc mods, stompmodreposts is a warning for reposts on all mods.
if you have a mirror that illigally redistributes mods, please post it on our issue tracker.

full credit goes to the author of @stopmodreposts for the inspiration.
if i get permission to do so, i will put his/her chart below and edit as needed.
